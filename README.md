# noClip_Protocol
A repository for my Game Development Final Project

NoClip Protocol is a fast-paced game that plays with certain game mechanics and the player is 
encouraged to think outside of the bounds of usual game movement to reach the goals in each level. 
From each level start, the player must travel through the stage and reach the exit, 
defeating or avoiding enemies along the way.
