//When the NoCLip affect activates, it will slow down time by about 10%
//It will make walls see-thorugh while effect is active
//It will change the player's weapon to a sword whil effect is activated
//It will send out a burst effect that alerts enemies near player and causes them to chase
//It will allow for medium strength and higher enemies to see the player though walls while effect is active
//BONUS: Sets gravity to zero and only allows player to move via sword swing dashes off of a surface.
