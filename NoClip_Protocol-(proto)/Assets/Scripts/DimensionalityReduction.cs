//  Will hold the code to change entire level contruction
/*
    Will work one of two ways:
    First:
        Will make one object the parent of all gameobjects
        Then Will change the scale of everything all at once.
    Second:
        Will flaten game into a 2D mode for a unique challange level
*/
//  I also want to experiment with the idea of using this script to alter the scaling
//  Of specific entities or even make it a mechanic for some enemies/bosses
