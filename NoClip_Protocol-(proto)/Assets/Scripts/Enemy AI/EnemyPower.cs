I want to add a script system to change the stats of certain enemies

This EnemyPower script should reference all the enemies through a list so that the stats of these specific enemies can be altered at the beginning of each level. The variables EnemyPower.cs needs to be able to change are:
Speed (controlled by NavMesh), maxHealth, sightRange, attackRange, timeBetwenAttacks, chaseMemoryTime, walkRange, atkDamage, as well as weaponType(string) and canWander(Bool)
*/
public class EnemyPower : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
